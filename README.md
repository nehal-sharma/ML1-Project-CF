Collaborative Filtering project ML1

Yelp dataset Restaurant recommender system


This is a project for Univ.AI ML-1 cohort, in which we created a restaurant recommender system using Collaborative Fltering.

The project workflow that we came up with is as follows :

Create a baseline estimate of a rating. This simple model will be created by recording the biases of each user and item to make a baseline estimate of a given user-item combination.

We then used a text similarity model based on the users "tips(text)" using item-to-item similarity as a method of collaborative filtering to improve our model further.

To this end, we performed EDA on the data, specifically to look at relevant business attributes, user attributes, and reviews. We reasoned that these are the core information needed to link users and businesses with their preferences. Hence, we disregarded data which was not useful for model.
